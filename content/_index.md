    intro: |
      We will be developing an online tool
      to store your passwords securely and privately.

      But it’s not about the app,
      this is an educational project,
      the important part is the process of building it.

      The experience of creating the tool
      will be documented extensively creating much more than a web application.

    title: About the author
    intro: |
      My name is [Javier Márquez](http://arqex.com) and
      I am a software engineer
      that has been using and creating opensource tools for years.

      I've always liked to write about software development but there has always been more important things to do.

      With the Passpill Project I am trying to turn my priorities upside down: The important part is [writing articles](https://medium.com/passpill-project)!

      You can know more about my reasons to create all of this by reading [the project introduction article](https://medium.com/passpill-project/the-loneliness-and-joy-of-programming-e2854dbfdb69).
